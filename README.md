## ProyectoFinalGrupo2 :fork_and_knife:
[See here <=-](https://github.com/aalvareznet/DotNet/tree/main/ProyectoFinalGrupo2)

This is a very small proyect. However, it shows my first steps with backend. First of all, I used libraries with the data access, entities and logic. I used EntityFramework and LINQ to conect the code with SQL. Then, I used WCF to create a service with all of this. Then, I created the ProyectoFinalGrupo2IU ([This one](https://github.com/aalvareznet/DotNet/tree/main/ProyectoFinalGrupo2IU)), that is (kinda) the front end of this proyect. I created references for the services, and then used the services created before to connect the frontend with the backend.

For this proyect I used:
- C# .Net
- EntityFramework
- LINQ
- WCF
- MVC
- Blazor

For this proyect I used:
