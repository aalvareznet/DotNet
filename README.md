.Net learning proyects

### ProyectoFinalGrupo2

This is a very small proyect. However, it shows my first steps with backend. First of all, I used libraries with the data access, entities and logic. I used EntityFramework and LINQ to conect the code with SQL. Then, I used WCF to create a service with all of this. Then, I created the ProyectoFinalGrupo2IU, that is (kinda) the front end of this proyect. I created references for the services, and then used the services created before to connect the frontend with the backend.
