# DotNet
Here is my path. The path that will take me to achieve my goals. The path that will give me everything I've ever wanted.
I hope you like it. And if you have any comment, please let me know. :computer: :keyboard: :computer_mouse: :headphones:

## ProyectoFinalGrupo2 :fork_and_knife:
[See here <=-](https://github.com/aalvareznet/DotNet/tree/main/ProyectoFinalGrupo2)

This is a very small proyect. However, it shows my first steps with backend. First of all, I used libraries with the data access, entities and logic. I used EntityFramework and LINQ to conect the code with SQL. Then, I used WCF to create a service with all of this. Then, I created the ProyectoFinalGrupo2IU ([This one](https://github.com/aalvareznet/DotNet/tree/main/ProyectoFinalGrupo2IU)), that is (kinda) the front end of this proyect. I created references for the services, and then used the services created before to connect the frontend with the backend.

For this proyect I used:
- C# .Net
- EntityFramework
- LINQ
- WCF
- MVC
- Blazor


## FishesAPI :fish: :whale:
[See here <=-](https://github.com/aalvareznet/DotNet/tree/main/FishesApi)

This is a very simple API, that connects with a Database. Theme in this database is fishes. In this one I created the database as **code first**, something that I've never done before. Database is conected with an API, that holds the CRUD. Then, I created some validatios using FluetValidation

For this proyect I used:
- C# .Net
- EntityFramework
- LINQ
- API
- FluentValidation

## Membership Management :convenience_store: :hotel: :department_store:

This is a more complex API than the last one. Lets imagine a Backend of a users and membership management app. This is what I belive it would look like. The new thing on this one is that I created a Hash manager. So, when a person creates an user, it would save it as a hash on the database. It also haves a verificator, so when a client wants to login, it would verify that the password is correct. So, for this I used:
[See here <=-](https://github.com/aalvareznet/DotNet/tree/main/Memberships)
- C# .Net
- EntityFramework
- Little bit of LINQ
- API
- FluentValidation
- Created a Hash manager.
- DTOs
